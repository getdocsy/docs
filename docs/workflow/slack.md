After you added Docsy to a channel, mention @Docsy in a thread. If everything is properly set up, Docsy will offer to create a PR for you.

4. Docsy offers to create a pull request with the information found in the thread.  
5. Docsy will include a link to the PR it creates, allowing you to easily access it.
