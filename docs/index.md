# Welcome to Docsy

Docsy is an AI coworker that suggests changes to product documentation based on Q&A threads from Slack.

Unlike full-blown documentation platforms like [readme.com](http://readme.com) or [gitbook.com](http://gitbook.com), which force you to migrate your docs to their platform and cost hundreds of dollars per month to keep running, Docsy simply opens PRs against your existing documentation git repo. No lock-in, just great docs.

## Data Privacy

### Which data does Docsy store?
Docsy stores your Slack Team identifier together with the settings you configure in app home. Docsy will not store any of your other data, nor will we use any other data for training. Docsy will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command.

### Where is Docsy hosted?
Docsy is hosted in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
